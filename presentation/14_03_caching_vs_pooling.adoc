=== Caching vs. Pooling?

---

* A Cache provides lookups by some keys or via indexes (e.g. String -> Object)
** Useful for complex object types to build direct relationships in an object graph
* A Pool returns a unique version of something using the same type for lookup (String -> String)
** Useful for reducing duplicate instances of simple immutable types
* What objects were cached in `ConferenceExplorerer` and how did this help?
** Country is cached and lookups provided by country name
** For 1 Million Generated conferences
