|* *Context:* Worked on an in-memory Financial Serices Java application that didn't fit in 32-bit memory space.

* *Mission:* Fit 6 gigabytes of stuff in 4 gigabytes of space

* *Problem:* Millions of small `List`, `Set`, `Map` instances created with default sized arrays
* *Solution*: Roll our own "small size" Java collections
