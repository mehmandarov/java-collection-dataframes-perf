=== The problems with in-memory Java architectures circa 2004

---

* Worked on an in-memory Financial Serices Java application that didn't fit in 32-bit memory space
** Problem: Millions of small `List`, `Set`, `Map` instances created with default sized arrays
** *Solution 1*: Roll our own "small size" Java collections
*** Started with memory-efficient `FixedSized` `List`, `Set`, `Map` for small sizes (0 - 6 elements)
*** Java 9+ introduced similar memory-efficient immutable collections in standard library
* Software problem (accessible memory) morphed into hardware problem (available memory)
** 64-bit JDK 1.4 release initially gave some relief, but increased total heap size
** https://www.baeldung.com/jvm-compressed-oops[Compressed OOPS] gave some relief for large heaps <32 gig and eventually <64 gig
** *Solution 2*: Roll our own memory-efficient mutable `Set`, `Map`, `List`
*** `UnifiedSet` not built out of `HashMap` like JDK `HashSet`
*** `UnifiedMap` does not store `Entry` objects and inlines keys and values in single array
*** `FastList` created backing array after calling `add` - http://wiki.jvmlangsummit.com/images/c/c2/Raab_Collections_Design.pdf[Empty lists stayed empty]
**** A similar optimization was eventually added to `ArrayList` and `HashMap` in a JDK 7 release
** *Solution 3*: Primitive collections were  added to Eclipse Collections
*** Primitive `List`, `Set`, `Bag`, `Stack`, `Map` - Mutable and Immutable types
