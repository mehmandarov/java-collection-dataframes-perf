=== The problems with in-memory Java architectures circa 2004

---

* Worked on an in-memory Financial Serices Java application that didn't fit in 32-bit memory space
** Mission: Fit 6 gigabytes of stuff in 4 gigabytes of space
** _In the face of overwhelming odds, I'm left with only one option. I'm gonna have to science the $%*# out of this._
*** -Mark Watney, from _The Martian_
* Problem: Millions of small `List`, `Set`, `Map` instances created with default sized arrays
** *Solution*: Roll our own "small size" Java collections
