| *Row-based structures (e.g. Objects in Collections)*
| *Column-based structures (e.g. DataFrame)*
| => *Advantages*
| => *Advantages*
| *** Custom tuning based on understanding of the data
*** Custom pooling and caching possible

|*** Object header cost per column
*** Great compression, cache locality and performance especially with primitive arrays

| => *Challenges*
| => *Challenges*

|*** Object header cost per row - 16 bytes
*** Object alignment cost - 8 bytes
**** *Note:* An empty object costs 16 bytes due to object alignment on 64-bit JVM
**** First reference is free which is why both `EmptyList` and `SingletonList` cost 16 bytes

|*** Tuning limited to available column types
**** DataFrame-EC currently only has Long value type for integral values
