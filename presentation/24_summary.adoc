=== Summary

---
* Data-oriented programming is feasible, flexible, and fun in Java
* Understanding and measuring your data is key
** Pooling can yield the biggest memory savings
** Object compression is possible using smaller primitive types with fixed number ranges
* Column-based Tabular Data Structures require less custom tuning
** Primitive columns generate more memory savings
** Providing support for smaller integral types can save additional memory
* Domain-oriented Row-based Structures are more flexible and can be tuned manually
** Immutable data structures are more memory efficient than their mutable counterparts
