=== The problems with in-memory Java architectures after 2004

---

==== Software problem (accessible memory) -> Hardware problem (available memory)
* 64-bit JDK 1.4 release initially gave some relief, but increased total heap size
* https://www.baeldung.com/jvm-compressed-oops[Compressed OOPS] allowed 32-bit references (4 bytes) in 64-bit heaps since JDK 1.6 (2006)
** Created a "sweet spot" threshold for large heaps <32 gig and eventually <64 gig
* *Solutions*:
** Roll our own memory-efficient mutable `Set`, `Map`, `List`
** Built primitive collections for `List`, `Set`, `Stack`, `Bag`, `Map`
