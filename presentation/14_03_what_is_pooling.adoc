---

* Pool
** A `Set` of unique values that we can `put` and `get` values out of

* What is a Pool useful for?
** Reducing the number of duplicate values of a specific set of data in memory
** Reusing references to a shared value (e.g. City) across many instances (e.g. Conference)
* How does DataFrame-EC pool data?
** DataFrame-EC uses Eclipse Collections `UnifiedSet` to pool data for each column
** This resulted in significant memory savings for our data without us having to do anything
* What fields were pooled manually in `Conference` for Java and Eclipse Collections and how did this help?
** For 1 Million Generated conferences
