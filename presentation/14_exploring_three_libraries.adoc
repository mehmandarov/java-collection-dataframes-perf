==== Java Streams => Lego (_9+_)
* Basic building blocks
* Some assembly required
* More of the low-level control
* Row-based Domain Objects

==== Eclipse Collections => Lego Technic (_16+_)
* More specialized building blocks
* Performance optimized
* Still compatible with the basic building blocks
* Row-based Domain Objects

==== DataFrame-EC => Lego Mindstorms (_10+_)
* Even more specialized building blocks
* High-level approach
* Still compatible with the basic building blocks
* Can be programmed to accomplish tasks
* Simplifies some of the tasks that can be harder to achieve otherwise
* Column-based Tabular Data Structure
