=== What is Pooling?

---

* Pool
** A `Set` of unique values that we can `put` and `get` values out of
** StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12670292/get-an-item-from-a-java-set/[Get an item from a Java Set]
* What is a Pool useful for?
** Reducing the number of duplicate values of a specific set of data in memory
** Reusing references to a shared value (e.g. City) across many instances (e.g. Conference)
* DataFrame-EC uses Eclipse Collections `UnifiedSet` to pool data for each column
** This resulted in significant memory savings for our data without us having to do anything
* We manually pooled the following fields during `Conference` record loading for Java and Eclipse Collections solutions
