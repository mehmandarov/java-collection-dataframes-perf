=== The Problem Today

---

* We have a lot of CSV data that needs to be processed in-memory.
* Can we do that in Java in an efficient way?
** How can we measure memory efficiency of data structures?
** What decisions can affect memory efficiency?
** Problem: Rows vs. Columns - which is better?
* What options do we have?
** Java Collections / Streams
*** Part of Java standard library
** link:https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections[Eclipse Collections]
*** Open Sourced by Goldman Sachs in 2012 as GS Collections
*** Open Source library maintained at Eclipse Foundation since 2015
** link:https://github.com/vmzakharov/dataframe-ec[DataFrame-EC]
*** Open Source library created by Vladimir Zakharov
*** Built on top of Eclipse Collections
* *NOTE:* This talk focuses on measuring memory cost and showing in-memory savings strategies, techniques and tricks
** *Disclaimer:* Sometimes memory savings will have positive or negative performance impacts. YMMV.
** You need to separately learn how to measure performance for your application and libraries
