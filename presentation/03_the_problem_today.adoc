=== The Problem Today

---

* Fast forward nearly two decades to 2023
** Many memory optimizations are included in https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections[Eclipse Collections] (EC) library
** New EC optimizations happen through issue reporting and open source contributions
** Dataframe libraries offer column based data processing approach
*** Problem: Rows vs. Columns - which is better?
* We have a lot of CSV data that needs to be processed in-memory.
* Can we do that in Java in an efficient way?
** How can we measure memory efficiency of data structures?
** What decisions can affect memory efficiency?
* What options do we have?
** Java Collections / Streams
*** Part of Java standard library
** link:https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections[Eclipse Collections]
*** Open Sourced by Goldman Sachs in 2012 as GS Collections
*** Open Source library maintained at Eclipse Foundation since 2015

*** Open Source library created by Vladimir Zakharov
*** Built on top of Eclipse Collections
