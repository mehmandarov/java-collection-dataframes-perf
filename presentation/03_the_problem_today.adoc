=== The (Simulated) Problem Today

---

* We have a lot of CSV data that needs to be processed in-memory.
* Can we do that in Java in an efficient way?
** How can we measure memory efficiency of data structures?
** What decisions can affect memory efficiency?
** Problem: Rows vs. Columns - which is better?
* What libraries will we explore?
** Java Collections / Streams
